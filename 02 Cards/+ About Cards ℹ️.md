### A Card is a piece of Knowledge. 

Think of it like a Post It Note with everything you have written down which lives in a folder inside your vault. 🗃️

## Helpful when;
- You need to build and connect knowledge or store information in your vault. 

Cards can be in your own words or a combination of facts and your interpretation of the subject or topic. Cards take a bit of getting used to because you can file them away and forget about them. 

>[!tip] 
>Try use Recall and Reflect often to flush out cards to distill and express to show your work!
