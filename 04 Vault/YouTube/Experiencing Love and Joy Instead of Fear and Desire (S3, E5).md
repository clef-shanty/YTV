## Notes

- There is a life available for everybody that is so beautiful
- Always excitement, joy, love and challenge
- Nothing to do with money or relationships
- Nothing to do with past, present or your future
- State of being, positioning oneself of a place inside
- Education Institutions fill our minds with facts, which is interesting but it doesn't help you to live this life because it encourages you to live in your mind
- What is the mind? The mind is a computer, it's one of the greatest gifts. Your body is an instrument. You have a body, a heart and a mind and then there is you, consciousness. 
- A computer can not know joy and excitement
- A computer can not know love
- Can't experience love, your mind has never and will never experience love.
