## Notes

- If you get [[depressed]] then you think it's your fault
- Your mind is happy to take responsibility for all of it
- Societal factors making it this way
- [[Depression]] is about identity
- Brain has a [[the default mode network]]
- [[Cognitive Distortions]] - no point of xyz
- Only take as much responsibility which is yours
- People taking too much responsibility, taking it away from those whom are responsible
