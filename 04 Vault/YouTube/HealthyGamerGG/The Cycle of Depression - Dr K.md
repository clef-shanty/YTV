## Notes
- Need to prevent pessimistic thoughts
- [[The Default Mode Network]], allows us to self reflect, think about ourselves, essentially forming an identity.
- Hard to see your own [[Cognitive Biases]]
- Pay attention to your filter (i.e what you accept and what you reject)
- Why do I think I got lucky? When getting an achievement
- Unplugging from your identity ([[meditate]]), nature, camping, etc
