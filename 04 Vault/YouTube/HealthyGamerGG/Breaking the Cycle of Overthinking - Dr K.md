## Notes

- Anxiety is not something you can control
- Response is important
- PTSD
- Life - we're in control of our actions but not in control of the result/outcomes
- Start where you're at not where you should be at
- Past experience, fantasy doesn't help us moved forward
- Success train is an illusion, you can't be successful building a solution based on perfect solutions, this is a bad strategy
- A decent solution is better, trial/error to fix it
- Reason we overthink is to avoid fear and then it generates more possibilities of fear
