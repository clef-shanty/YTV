## Notes

- Emotionally challenging journaling provokes the emotions we're trying to avoid but it's less effective than experiencing the event.
- Increase ability to tolerate negative emotions
- Building a narrative
- Stuck in Narrative (Focus on I or Focus on People)
- Stuck in Life - don't learn from our mistakes
- Journaling - understand where you're at
- Don't see the benefit straight away
- Write about an emotional experience you had
- Our attention spans are very short
- Write what you want
- Physically write
- Writing commits things to memory
- Capture your creative impulses
- Can't just practice, need to reply analysis for reflection
- [[Indriyas - Sense Organs]] (sight, smell, taste, touch, hear)
- When you allow yourself to resolve boredom with dopaminergic activities like video games you reinforce the idea that this is how to relieve yourself of boredom. 
- Your brain will learn to immediately reach for unproductive, dopaminergic activities to make the boredom stop
- If you can procrastinate on boredom your mind will have creative thoughts
- Creative impulses arise as a result
- Then reflect on them, ride out boredom
- Snowball of creative impulses
- Be creative and the better things will become
- Professional tipping point is naturally having creative impulses, then reflect of it which populates thoughts which will grow
- Reflect on work that you do is key in riding out boredom
