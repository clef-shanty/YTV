- Our mind doesn't do what we want it to do
- [[Hope]] that things work out tomorrow
- Your mind doesn't want to do the work
- Performance is widely variable
- How do you train your mind to [[focus]]
- Self - I need to [[focus]] (frontal lobe - delayed gratification and direct attention)
- Mind - Doesn't want too 
- Work vs Boredom vs Productivity vs Dopamine
- More intolerant to boredom you're then you're going to lean towards seeking out more dopamine activities
- If you want your mind to focus remember it revolves around boredom
- Giving your mind less options, if you don't want to work then you can only sleep or be bored.
- Work vs Sleep vs Boredom vs ~~Productivity~~ vs ~~Dopamine~~
- Practice focusing until your mind starts listening
- If you struggle to do the work (I don't feel like it) sit with self and work out why
- Why don't I feel like doing this? Notice your thoughts. 
- What's getting in the way?
- The mind tricks you, people waste their entire lives with mind trickery. Tell yourself, we're going to sit here until this gets done. Holding your mind hostage. 
- It all comes down to your [[Attention of Psychic Energy]]
- The more confidence you have in yourself, the more value you'll have to offer
