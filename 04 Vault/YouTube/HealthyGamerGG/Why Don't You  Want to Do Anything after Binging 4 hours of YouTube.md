## Notes
- Sometimes instead of doing what we're meant to do we spend time consuming technology. YouTube, Reddit, etc
- When you slip up you're very hard on yourself for not accomplishing anything
- What's going on in someone's brain when we participate in this type of behaviour? 
- Neuroscience says that there is a field being studied known as consumer neuroscience. Group of people studying the brain to figure out how to get humans to buy stuff and continue consuming internet stimuli. 
- By measuring dIPFC ([[Prefrontal Cortex]]) signals in the brain your free will is now known as the "internet attention market"
- Lots of research being done on the "[[Anterior Insula]]"
- Heavily involve in insight and orgasm. A lot of consciousness comes from this part of the brain. 
- The more aware I'm the less likely I'm to engage with technology
- Technology is finding ways to make us less aware by making us pay more attention and remain engaged in the content
- The less active your anterior insula is then the more likely you're to engage in the internet attention market. 
- Emerging field on neuroscience where people are publishing papers on the neuroscience by using neuro imagery. 

**1. Why do we start engaging with technology**
- Whether you do the task you should be doing is determined by your internal emotional state. The more confident and less fatigued you are the more you care about yourself and more positive emotions you feel. The more likely chance to do the task.
- Technology suppresses our negative emotional circuitry 
- Worse you feel about yourself the more likely you're to use technology
- More fatigued you're the more likely you're to use technology

**2. Why do we persist in engaging with technology**
- As it becomes more engaging we suppress the anterior insula which suppresses our negative emotions
- Example One More Turn (Civ6)
- Then we blame and hate ourselves. All the negative emotion comes back. Leads t procrastination. Hard to focus when you self loath yourself. 
- Motivation come from (Inspiration, Excitement, Confidence)
- Recognise black in white thinking (All or nothing thinking) this is a sign of charged emotional activity in the hippocampus (your emotionally charged)
- Very few things in life are black and white. 
- Negative emotions should not be ignored for long periods of time because they manifest over time. They always need to be dealt with. They will deal with you until you deal with them.
- Ask yourself how you feel and why and speak kindly to yourself. Give it value. Makes it easier to do a task. 
- There is an attention marketplace which savvy people are realising and exploiting
 
**3. Why does long term engagement do to our brain, motivation and self esteem**
