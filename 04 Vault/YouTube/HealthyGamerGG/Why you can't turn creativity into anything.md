## Notes

### The Problem
- Create energy comes in burst then fizzles
- Problems with follow through
- Experience Impatience and Frustration
- Instant Gratification the root cause? via Video Games, etc
- What does Gaming do to the brain?
- Play Game = Action = Reward = Action = Reward
- Training the brain 
- The Brain is designed to be Efficient - see [[Step away from Efficiency to get things done]] and detests diversity but the good news is we can train it
- Games = Impulse after boredom = Reward is gratification
- Content = Impulse after boredom = Reward is gratification

A burst of creative energy = Acting on your Impulse
Then when you get frustrated and impatient by Day 30 you give up

**The Formula everyone is looking for is**

Explosion of Creativity + Discipline = Success
- This is the problem
- Same thing as above problem
- Doomed for failure because you're starting the wrong way

### The Solution
- Need to train your impulsivity (frontal lobe function)
- Can do this using any [[Meditation Techniques]] 
- Fix Point Gazing (also known as Trataka)
- Train attention to [[Focus on One Thing]]
- [[Focus]] practice - wait for the wondering mind
- An example is lighting some incense, watching the smoke, when the mind wanders bring it back to the smoke. Repeat to train the brain
- Slow down your start
- Make a schedule to do the thing (1-2 hours max)
- Limited amount of [[Energy]]
- Space out [[Creativity]] Energy to last into [[Habits]] formation
- Actions are then decoupled from reward
- [[Focus]] on 3 things to do each day to stop your mind from wandering
- This allows your [[Mindset]] needs to change
- [[Reducing Impulsiveness]] is the key
- Only then will your results be different

## Best Ideas

1.  Practice Meditation 
2. Fix Point Gazing (not on anything you're craving)
