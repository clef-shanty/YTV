## Notes

- Everyone is telling you to board the train but there are no longer any train tracks
- How do I find my passion?
- Have idea that passion is something you find to make everything easy
- What is this thing we call passion?
- Once we understand what it is
- Problems we run into when looking
- Mistake #1 Passion = Career / Job
- Individuals have;
		- Different interest 
		- Different fulfilment
		- Different circumstances
- What we find interesting is individualistic
- People look for passion via institutions which is the wrong place to look
- Mistake #2 = Think of passion as something that can be found
- Implies passion is external 
- Passion is individual in nature, ask yourself, what gets me excited by life, look back, when did I feel fulfilled. Default mind will say nothing

- Don't restrict yourself to a Job
- The World Rewards Value
- If passionate, it's easier to give 100%
- What takes do I want to do daily?
- Raised in institutions and we don't know how to deal with freedom of choice
- The world used to be railroads and train tracks, trains going no where
- We're paralysed by Choice
- We haven't evolved for this many choices, our brains can't deal with it
- Can't use the old way of doing things
- We don't know how to look within because gaming is externalised and is high jacking your brain
