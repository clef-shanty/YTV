## Notes

- Efficiency is actually the cause of the problem
- We view efficiency as a good thing because the more efficient we're the more we can accomplish, the more we will get done, the more productive we will be.
- The pursuit of efficiency causes the mind to be scattered.
- Efficiency allows you to do more than one thing

- Efficiency allows the mind to remain greedy
- Efficiency allows us not to prioritise, because if you have 10 things you need to find a way to accomplish them all.
- Unwilling mind that doesn't want to give up tasks leads to a scattered mind
- Being too efficient causes you to become _overwhelmed_, _scattered_ with your _energy being spread too thin_.
- Your mind can't focus on a single one task when it's juggling multiple tasks.
- The more you try to do the more your attention is scattered

- The Solution is to step away from Efficiency.
- Not willing to give things up you can't focus on one task.
- Attention becomes scattered when you're unwilling to give things up. We don't perform very well.
- Notice when your mind seek efficiency. Tunnel down into your mind.

> Eat a meal = don't watch or listen or have a conversation
> Toilet = Stay clear of your phone
> Any Activity = Just do that thing
> Every time you do that you mind has to learn to give something up. Train the brain muscle which facilitates the flow state, setting boundaries, etc.
