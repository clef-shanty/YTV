# Stablebit Drivepool Overview - Windows Disk Drive Pooling


![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yFVbuzPLv0o/maxresdefault.jpg)


## Intro to Drivepool [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=0s)


- Drive Pool is a Windows-based drive pooling solution that allows users to combine multiple disk drives into a single volume or drive letter.
- Windows has native options for drive pooling, but Drive Pool offers unique features and benefits.
- Drive Pool is a good option for users who want to run a Windows-based file server without the complexity or expense of a Network Attached Storage (NAS) setup.



## Windows Built In Pooling Options Disk Management [(00:00:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=44s)


- Windows has built-in options for combining multiple hard drives into a single volume, allowing for increased storage capacity.
- These options include spanned volumes, striped volumes, and mirrored volumes.
- Spanned volumes combine disks of different sizes into a single larger volume, similar to Jagpool, but with key differences.
- Striped volumes, similar to [[Data striping | RAID 0]], distribute data across all disks for faster read and write speeds, but data loss occurs if any disk fails.
- Mirrored volumes create a single drive letter by writing data to two identical disks, ensuring data availability even if one disk fails.
- RAID 5, which requires a [[Windows Server]] license, is not available in the native [[Logical Disk Manager | Disk Management]] tool.



## Windows Storage Spaces [(00:03:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=203s)


- Windows Storage Spaces is a built-in feature that allows users to create storage pools from multiple physical drives.
- Users can create different types of pools, including simple, two-way mirror, three-way mirror, and parity.
- While Windows Storage Spaces offers some redundancy options, it may not provide complete data protection in the event of a drive failure, which is where third-party solutions like StableBit DrivePool can be beneficial.



## Download and Install Free Trial [(00:04:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=273s)


- StableBit DrivePool is a paid product that offers a 30-day free trial.
- The free trial can be accessed by downloading the software from the StableBit website.
- The free trial is only valid for one installation per machine and cannot be reset by uninstalling and reinstalling the software.
- The software is available for both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows operating systems.
- After downloading, the software can be installed by double-clicking the downloaded file.
- During installation, users can choose a custom installation location or accept the default location.
- Once installed, users can activate a 30-day free trial license.



## Adding empty disks to pool [(00:06:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=410s)


- Drive Pool can be used with both new and existing hard drives.
- When adding a new drive to the pool, Drive Pool will automatically format the drive and assign it a drive letter.
- Drive Pool supports [[NTFS]] partitions only.
- Drive Pool creates drive letters for each individual drive, as well as a drive letter for the pool itself.
- Data should be managed on the drive pool drive letter, not the individual drive letters.
- When a drive is added to the pool, a "PoolPart" folder is created on the drive.
- The "PoolPart" folder contains a portion of the data from the pool, distributed across all drives in the pool.
- To view the "PoolPart" folder, hidden files and folders must be enabled in [[File Explorer | Windows Explorer]].
- When files are copied to the drive pool, they are distributed across all drives in the pool.



## Adding disk to pool that has existing data [(00:11:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=705s)


- To add a disk with existing data to a DrivePool, follow the same process as adding an empty disk.
- After adding the disk, the existing data on the disk will not be automatically added to the pool.
- To add the data to the pool, drag and drop the folders from the newly added disk into the DrivePool's "Pool Part" folder.
- Once the data is added to the pool, the DrivePool will rebalance the data across all disks according to its default distribution rules.
- The rebalancing process will distribute a larger percentage of data to the largest disk in the pool.



## Balancing data across disks [(00:15:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=900s)


- Drive Pool offers options for balancing data across disks, including immediate balancing, scheduled balancing, and no automatic balancing.
- The balancing tab provides options for equalizing disk space, optimizing [[Solid-state drive | SSDs]], and evacuating files from problematic hard drives.
- Drive Pool allows users to specify where files are stored, including the ability to store specific folders on designated disks.
- Drive Pool offers duplication functionality, allowing users to create duplicates of files or folders across multiple disks for data redundancy.
- Users can choose to duplicate entire pools or specific folders, with the duplication level adjustable based on the number of disks in the pool.



## Disk transfer and disk failure [(00:18:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=1139s)


- DrivePool utilizes [[NTFS]] disks, ensuring data accessibility even if the computer or motherboard fails. Files can be accessed by connecting the disk to another NTFS-compatible machine.
- DrivePool allows for transferring the license and reconfiguring the pool on a new computer, preserving [[Data integrity | data integrity]].
- Removing a disk from the pool results in the loss of files stored exclusively on that disk. However, files stored on other disks within the pool remain accessible.
- Re-inserting a previously removed disk into the pool automatically reintegrates it, restoring access to the files stored on that disk.



## Setting up as a shared network drive [(00:20:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVbuzPLv0o&t=1255s)


- Drive Pool can be set up as a shared network drive by right-clicking the Drive Pool, selecting "Properties," then "Sharing," and sharing the drive.
- Once shared, the Drive Pool can be accessed remotely from another computer on the network by entering the IP address of the computer hosting the Drive Pool.
- Drive Pool can be used to combine multiple smaller drives into a single larger drive, which can be useful for storing large files like games or for creating a file server.
